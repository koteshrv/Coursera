Research two microcontrollers and provide information about them from their datasheets. There are several microcontroller manufacturers that you can investigate including Atmel, Microchip, Freescale, TI, etc. For each microcontroller, report the following information. (Be sure to include a link to an online reference where you found this information.)  

Clock frequency
Bitwidth of the datapath
Size of Flash memory
Number of pins
Does the microcontroller contain an Analog-to-Digital Converter? If so, how many bits of precision does it have?

ATmega 2560
Clock frequency                - 16 MIPS
Bitwidth of the datapath    - 16 bit
Size of Flash memory       - 256KB
Number of pins                 - 100
Yes, the microcontroller contains Analog-to-Digital Converter. It has 10 bits of precision.

ATmega 328P
Clock frequency                - 16 MIPS
Bitwidth of the datapath    - 16 bit
Size of Flash memory       - 32 KB
Number of pins                 - 100
Yes, the microcontroller contains Analog-to-Digital Converter. It has 10 bits of precision.

Research the Arduino and Raspberry Pi platforms. 

Indicate if there are operating systems which can be used on each platform. If there are, list those operating systems
State whether the operating systems are open source or not. 

There is no operating system for Arduino.

There are operating systems for Raspberry Pi.
Some of the operating systems of Raspberry Pi are:
Raspbian, OSMC(Open Source Media Center), RISC 
The above mentioned operating systems are Open source.
